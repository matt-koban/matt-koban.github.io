Hello! I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Toronto working under the supervision of Lisa Jeffrey and Steven Rayan. 
My research interests include complex/algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. 
More specifically I am interested in moduli theories of Higgs bundles, and quiver varieties, as well as the ways they appear in the context of quantum field theories and 3-dimensional mirror symmetry.
